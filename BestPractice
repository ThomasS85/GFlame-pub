- Use low resolution and medium accuracy for prototyping
- Reinitialisation strongly affects noise in surface area data -> Best set s.reinit.intervalStep to 1
- It is better to reinitialize more often than to increase accuracy
- if the accuracy for the reinitialisation is set to high or very high results become more noisy (at least with axial flame holder)
  and the simulation gets slower
- it is better to invest more in spatial accuracy than in higher order temporal schemes (also because they cause some troubles
  at the boundaries)
- With s.holdFlame = 'axial' and high accuracy there has been a problem at the boundaries where some weired things happend. 
    Maybe radial flame holder is better, at least with high accuracy?
- Initial condition should be a signed distance function (at least close to boundaries) so that the boundaries are always signed      
   distancefunctions
- Always rename example settings files! (Otherwise they might be used instead of local ones!)
